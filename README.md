# s3_bucket_permission_vulnerability

Unlike many AWS resources, s3 bucket arns do not include the resource account number. Therefore, IAM policies that allow or deny access can only specify the bucket name.

Bucket names are globally unique in AWS. When a name is deleted, it becomes available for another AWS user (after a substantial delay ~1 hour).

If an S3 bucket is deleted, another user can intercept the logs.

With an account number and an S3 bucket name, a malicious user could create a private bucket and give permission only to the target account.
